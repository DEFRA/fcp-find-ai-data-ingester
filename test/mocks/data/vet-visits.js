  description: 'Farmers who keep cattle, sheep and pigs can get funding to pay for a vet to visit their farm and carry out a health and welfare review of their livestock.',
  details: {
    attachments: [],
    body: '<div class="govspeak"><p>The annual health and welfare review is part of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) offer.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a livestock farmer, you can get funding for a vet or team chosen by a vet to visit your farm and carry out a health and welfare review of eligible livestock.</p>\n\n<p>The review is designed to be primarily for you and will not be used for inspections or compliance.</p>\n\n<p>It’ll help you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reduce endemic diseases such as bovine viral diarrhoea (<abbr title="bovine viral diarrhoea">BVD</abbr>) in cattle, porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (<abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr>) in pigs and the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>\n  <li>improve the welfare of your animals</li>\n  <li>increase productivity</li>\n  <li>make sure your use of veterinary medicines and vaccines is appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id="who-can-apply">Who can apply</h2>\n\n<p>To be eligible to apply, you must have one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>11 or more beef cattle</li>\n  <li>11 or more dairy cattle</li>\n  <li>21 or more sheep</li>\n  <li>51 or more pigs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The livestock must be registered in England and you need to be responsible for their welfare.</p>\n\n<p>Your business must have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a single business identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) linked to a county parish holding (<abbr title="county parish holding">CPH</abbr>) number registered in England</li>\n  <li>a <abbr title="county parish holding">CPH</abbr> number that’s permanent or temporary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can only apply for a review on a <abbr title="county parish holding">CPH</abbr> registered in England. You cannot apply for a review on <abbr title="county parish holdings">CPHs</abbr> registered in Wales or Scotland.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title="county parish holding">CPH</abbr> number cannot be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an 8,000 number used for abattoirs, pet food manufacturers, racing pigeon establishments and showgrounds</li>\n  <li>a 9,000 number used for poultry keepers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll only be able to have a review of one eligible type of livestock at first. If you have more than one eligible type, you’ll need to choose which one to have reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>If you have more than one species of eligible livestock, or if they’re kept at different geographical locations, you may be eligible for more than one annual review in the future. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) and Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) will publish more information on GOV.UK when it’s available.</p>\n\n<h2 id="how-much-funding-you-can-apply-for">How much funding you can apply for</h2>\n\n<p>There’s a payment for each species. It is not a payment for each animal.</p>\n\n<p>The funding will cover the endemic disease or condition testing costs. It’ll also contribute towards the costs for both your time and the vet’s time.</p>\n\n<p>The payment for each species is different. This is because the required testing for some species may take longer to do and some results cost more to analyse.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be paid:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>£684 for a pig review</li>\n  <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>\n  <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>\n  <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id="what-the-review-will-include">What the review will include</h2>\n\n<p>The review is flexible. You and the vet can decide what the health and welfare priorities are for the farm and focus on these.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no set amount of time for a review but it’s likely to take between 2 to 3 hours of your time and the vet’s time.</p>\n\n<p>The review will need to include the required testing of livestock and the vet will discuss the test results with you. They’ll recommend actions you can take to improve health and welfare based on testing and their time on the farm.</p>\n\n<p>The review requires:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>testing for the endemic disease or condition of the livestock type you’re having reviewed to recommended standards - <abbr title="bovine viral diarrhoea">BVD</abbr> in dairy and beef cattle, effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (<abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr>) in pigs</li>\n  <li>the vet advising on the health and welfare of the livestock - including issues such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring</li>\n  <li>a written report and summary prepared by the vet with agreed recommendations and actions to improve the livestock’s health and welfare</li>\n  <li>you to share some information with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Optional areas may include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a check of your biosecurity measures and advice on improving them</li>\n  <li>recommendations about medicines used on your farm including antibiotics and vaccinations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id="what-happens-after-the-review">What happens after the review</h2>\n\n<p>Once the vet has completed the review, they’ll provide you with a report that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>endemic disease or condition test results from the laboratory</li>\n  <li>advice or suggested species-specific health and welfare actions</li>\n  <li>other review findings - for example, biosecurity recommendations and medicine usage</li>\n  <li>the agreed priority recommendations and actions for you to improve the health and welfare of your livestock</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will not ask to see the report. It will also not be used for site visits or other compliance checks.</p>\n\n<p>When you claim your funding, you may be required to provide the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> with the review summary as evidence that the review has taken place. You’ll only need to supply the review summary if the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> asks for it.</p>\n\n<h2 id="farmers-how-to-apply-for-a-review">Farmers: how to apply for a review</h2>\n\n<p>Read the guidance to find out <a rel="external" href="https://apply-for-an-annual-health-and-welfare-review.defra.gov.uk/apply/guidance-for-farmers" class="govuk-link">how to apply for an annual health and welfare review of livestock</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id="vets-how-to-carry-out-a-review">Vets: how to carry out a review</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re a vet and want to learn more about carrying out a review, read the guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://apply-for-an-annual-health-and-welfare-review.defra.gov.uk/apply/guidance-for-vet" class="govuk-link">how to carry out an annual health and welfare review of livestock</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id="background-to-the-review">Background to the review</h2>\n\n<p>The funding will be available for 3 years, after which <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will reassess the details of the review.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> began testing the first annual health and welfare reviews in September 2022.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll continue to make improvements and iterations over time, using feedback from farmers and industry experts.</p>\n\n</div>',
